# Mod Outline

## No specific dialogue needs to be written in here, but this contains all detail of how everything should flow + piece together.

### **Some important things to note:**
 - Starting in Act 1 (as if it were a fresh playthrough) and is mostly the same.
 - Addition of Monika in poem minigame plus new reactions for her (do at a later point if neccessary).
 - script-ch5 is the *main* change. Anything after that will be new and **not** an edit of any of the original game acts.
 - *Add anything else of additional importance here*
 
 
## **Beginning changes (Ch1-Ch5 scripts)**
 - Monika is added to the poem game.
 - On day 1, if you choose Monika, you have an option that affects which book you read during free time at the club:
   - Yuri's book (Portrait of Markov)
   - Natsuki's manga (Parfait Girls)
   - Monika's book (Summer Tales)
 - (Note: this doesn't affect gameplay at all and has no bearing upon the endings available. It's just for fun!)
 
 - If you take Sayori's route (both days) in act I, Monika will talk to Sayori, leading to options that affect her fate.
 - If you dont' take Sayori's route (both days) in act I, Monika won't talk to Sayori and her fate will be decided later on.
 - If you take any other route (both days) in act I, Sayori will still end up spaced out on Friday but will not kill herself on Monday.
 
 - There will be an option to save Sayori on Monday morning if you take her route.
   - If you choose the save option, you will spend the festival with her.
   - If you choose the not-save option, she will kill herself and a bad ending for Sayori will occur.
 
 - If you didn't take her route on both days, she will not reveal her depression until later. She will attend the festival.
 - (Note: Sayori's death only ends the game in her route. If you choose any of the other girls, it can happen later and doesn't end the game)

 - On the weekend, you can still only help either Yuri or Natsuki, since Sayori and Monika don't need help for their task.
   - If you choose Yuri, you find out about her cutting. You won't be able to help yet unless you took Yuri's route (at least one day).
   - If you choose Natsuki, you find out about her dad and health issues. You won't be able to help yet unless you took Natsuki's route (at least one day).
   - If you chose Monika and Sayori (any order) in the first two days, you can help both Natsuki and Yuri on different days. You still won't be able to help with their issues yet.

## **Additional scripts (new chapters)**
 - *Put changes here. Include ```ch(x).rpa``` file name if possible*
