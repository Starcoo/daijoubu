# Mod Outline

## No specific dialogue needs to be written in here, but this contains all detail of how everything should flow + piece together.

### **Some important things to note:**
 - Starting in Act 1 (as if it were a fresh playthrough) and is mostly the same.
 - Addition of Monika in poem minigame plus new reactions for her (do at a later point if neccessary).
 - script-ch5 is the *main* change. Anything after that will be new and **not** an edit of any of the original game acts.
 - *Add anything else of additional importance here*
 
 
## **Beginning changes (Ch1-Ch5 scripts)**
 - *Put changes here. Include ```ch(x).rpa``` file name if possible*



## **Additional scripts (new chapters)**
 - *Put changes here. Include ```ch(x).rpa``` file name if possible*
